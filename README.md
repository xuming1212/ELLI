This is RELLI (Real Extreme Low-Light Image) dataset, you will find details related to it in the paper "Extreme Low-light Image Enhancement Using Convolutional Neural Network"

Description

RELLI contains 1524 pictures (508  groups), in .tiff format with resolution of 2688×2200. Each group consists of 3 pictures of the same scene, but distinct by exposure time.    From which, 1s and 3s-exposure images are extreme low-light objects, and 70s-exposure images can be served as ground-truth. The photography detail can be found in the paper.

Naming Convention

group number.exposure time.tif   

eg

001.1000.tif  

the 1000 ms (1 s) exposure-time picture from the first group 

Example

Two groups here as examples of RELLI for you to determine if it suits your purpose.
